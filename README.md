# diversity-analysis
Checking for diversity in newspaper articles using sentiment analysis.

This task was created in the context of a project for checking diversity in newspaper articles.
The dataset used comes from Harvard Dataverse and consists of a number of English articles that were
collected by a project within 3 months from December of 2016 to march 2017. The source of these news 
articles are from ABC News, CNN news, The Huffington Post, BBC News, DW News, TASS News, Al Jazeera News, 
China Daily and RTE News. All of them are collected by using RSS feeds of each news site.

To perform the sentiment analysis, a number of natural language API's were used.
